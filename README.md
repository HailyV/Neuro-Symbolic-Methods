# Neuro-Symbolic Methods: Biomedical Knowledge Discovery and Exploration

This repository contains 3 mentor-guided replication projects conducted under the supervision of **Dr. Justin Eldridge** (UC San Diego) and **Solix Mentors Raju Pusapati** and **Murali Krishnam**.  
These projects explore how **AI**, **large language models (LLMs)**, and **semantic tools** can enhance biomedical research in **drug discovery**, **repurposing**, and **ontology-based reasoning**.

## Notes

Hello TA, currently our mentors are having us focus on multiple replication projects so the code here currently reflects that. As of the due date I have uploaded two of them, but there should be more after. Thank you! :)
